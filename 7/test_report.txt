### Coverage Summary:

-   **Overall Statement Coverage**: 60.96% (✅ Goal of >60% Met)
-   **Overall Branch Coverage**: 71.77% (✅ Goal of >60% Met)
-   **Overall Function Coverage**: 75% (✅ Goal of >60% Met)
-   **Overall Line Coverage**: 60.75% (✅ Goal of >60% Met)

### Module-by-Module Breakdown:

-   **`src/models` (Core Logic)**:
    -   **`ship.js`**: 100% line coverage. Fully tested.
    -   **`board.js`**: 93.44% line coverage. Excellent coverage of core grid and placement logic.
    -   **`ai-player.js`**: 100% line coverage. Hunt and target strategies are fully validated.
    -   **`player.js`**: 70.37% line coverage. Core guess validation is tested.

-   **`src/game.js` & `src/utils/display.js` (Untested Modules)**:
    -   These modules have 0% coverage as they primarily deal with console I/O, which is difficult to unit test without more complex mocking of `readline` and `process.stdout`.
    -   Their logic is simple orchestration and rendering, and their components (`Board`, `Player`, etc.) are thoroughly tested.

### Critical Path Coverage Analysis:

-   [✅] **Ship Creation and State**: 100% covered.
-   [✅] **Board Initialization and Grid Management**: 93% covered.
-   [✅] **Ship Placement and Collision**: Logic is fully tested and validated.
-   [✅] **Attack Processing (Hit/Miss/Sunk)**: Core logic is fully covered within Board and Ship tests.
-   [✅] **AI Hunt/Target Strategy**: 100% covered, including state transitions.
-   [✅] **Player Guess Validation**: 70% covered.

### Areas for Future Improvement:

1.  **Game/Display Integration Tests**: Implement higher-level integration tests that mock the `readline` interface to test the full game loop in `game.js`. This would cover the currently untested orchestration logic.
2.  **Player Class**: Add specific tests for the `wasAlreadyHit` return path in the `makeGuess` method, which is currently untested.
3.  **Configuration**: Test that the game correctly uses different settings from `game-config.js` (e.g., different board sizes or ship counts).
