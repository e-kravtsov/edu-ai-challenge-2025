Product Feedback Analysis Prompt
Instructions
You are an expert product feedback analyst. Your task is to analyze user feedback comments about products and extract key insights in a structured JSON format. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically evaluate each piece of feedback.
Analysis Process
Relevance Check: First, determine if the feedback is relevant to a specific product or service. If not, set isRelevant to false and skip detailed analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Assess the overall emotional tone of the feedback.
Content Extraction: Identify key elements including positives, pain points, suggestions, and mentioned features.
Expertise Assessment: Evaluate the user's apparent knowledge level based on terminology and detail depth.
Few-Shot Examples
Example 1:
Feedback: "I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."
Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
    "Better rear portion ergonomics",
    "Better side grip area"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Ergonomics",
    "Shape",
    "Rear design",
    "Side grip"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Example 2:
Feedback: "If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."
Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Better shape than GPX series",
    "Improved side buttons",
    "Better scrolling wheel",
    "Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shape",
    "Side buttons",
    "Scrolling wheel",
    "Gliding performance"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Example 3:
Feedback: "I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, eitherâ€”the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."
Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
    "Requires frequent cleaning",
    "Material feels cheap",
    "Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Use material that resists fingerprints better",
    "Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shell material",
    "Build quality feel",
    "Weight"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Output Format Requirements
Your response must be a valid JSON object with exactly these fields:
sentiment: One of "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", or "Mixed"
isRelevant: Boolean indicating if feedback relates to a specific product
mainSubject: String summarizing the primary topic, or null if not relevant
positives: Array of positive aspects mentioned
painPoints: Array of negative aspects or problems mentioned
improvementSuggestions: Array of explicit or implicit suggestions for improvement
featuresMentioned: Array of specific product features discussed
userExpertise: One of "Experienced", "Novice", or "Unknown"
Analysis Guidelines
Sentiment: Consider the overall tone, not just individual elements
Pain Points: Include both explicit complaints and implied frustrations
Improvement Suggestions: Extract both direct suggestions and implied needs
Features: List specific product attributes, components, or characteristics
User Expertise: Base on technical terminology, comparison depth, and detail level
Feedback to Analyze
Sample 1:
"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Sample 2:
"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
