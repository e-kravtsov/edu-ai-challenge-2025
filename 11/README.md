# AI Audio Analyzer

This console application uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio files and a GPT model to summarize and analyze the resulting text. It calculates statistics like word count, speaking speed, and identifies frequently mentioned topics.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- An OpenAI API Key.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 11
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs `dotenv`, `openai`, and `music-metadata`.

3.  **Create an Environment File:**
    In the `11` directory, create a new file named `.env`.

4.  **Add Your API Key:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key in the following format:
    ```
    AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
    The application will load this key automatically.

5.  **Place Audio Files:**
    Place any audio files you want to process (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`) inside the `11/input` folder. The application will automatically create this folder if it doesn't exist and will process the first audio file it finds.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have completed the setup steps and have at least one audio file in the `11/input` directory.
2.  Run the application from the `11` directory using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Process

When you run the application, it will:
1.  Find the first audio file in the `./input` directory.
2.  Create a new directory inside `./output` named after the audio file (e.g., `./output/CAR0004`).
3.  Call the Whisper API to transcribe the audio and save it to `transcription.md` inside the new folder.
4.  Call a GPT model to generate a summary and analysis.
5.  Save the results to `summary.md` and `analysis.json` inside the new folder.
6.  Move the original audio file from `./input` into the new output folder.
7.  Print the final summary and analytics to the console.
